              The Charminar (lit.â€‰'four minarets') is a monument located in
              Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is
              a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of
              Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence
              of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both
              historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its
              popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has
              become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in
              Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival
              celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is
              adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million)
